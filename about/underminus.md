# Underminus
I have played MMOs since late 2004 and have been an active member of a number of communities. In January 2007 I quit gaming for a few months and sold my accounts off before restarting on Oceanic servers with a friend to form a guild called Afterlife. We later merged and made Absolution and eventually the guild was renamed to Inexorable. In November 2010 I decided to start looking into privately hosted servers. Since 2013 I have been a gamer, tester, and staff member of several emulator projects such as Vanillagaming, Enjorius, Valkyrie, Elysium, Nostalrius, Nostralia, The Barrens, Venture Bay and now I'm here with the Wobblin' Goblin team.

I bring a general game and community management knowledge to the table to help bridge the gap between the users and the developers. I have known Jeffi since the late 2007 raiding days and I have found working on this project an absolute pleasure. When ideas are dreamt up or solutions to bugs are needed, Jeffi is fast to get to work on making corrections. In my experience it is extremely rare outside of well funded, large scale projects to find a developer who works as hard and fast as Jeffi does. This makes the project something I am proud to be part of.

I look forward to seeing how we can help you level up.
