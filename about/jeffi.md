# Jeffi
I started mucking around with Linux when I was a teenager and was laughed at by my peers because I couldn't get my wireless driver working. Eventually I got a Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology from the University of Sydney and tutored for two years during my degree. After my degree I worked in the IT industry for a number of years.

In August 2021 I started working on an emulator with Underminus that could support low populations like in the Oceanic region. I had a lot of fun with the unique challenge and really enjoyed developing the game around the players. I felt a bit like a dungeon master from a tabletop RPG and saw the potential for others to start their own servers for their friends.

In May 2022 I made Wobblin' Goblin an open source organization based around community, education, and fun.
