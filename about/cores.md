# Core
Reverse-engineered from the inputs and outputs of clients of popular multiplayer online role playing games such as World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI, the core emulates the server in the relationship between the client and server in an online game. Open source cores give the user the freedom to run, study, change, and improve their server.
