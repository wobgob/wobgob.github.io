      class="sidenote">Docker is a platform for helping people build, share and
      run applications. Docker Desktop is a graphical application for building
      and sharing applications and services on the Docker platform.</span> is a
      great way to start an <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.azerothcore.org/">AzerothCore</a> server for yourself or
      for your family and friends.</p>

      <p>We assume that you are familiar with playing on a private server and
      have a 3.3.5a client. We'll be relying on Docker Desktop and in-game
      commands to run our server so minimal technical expertise is required.</p>

      <p>The Docker image<label for="sn-docker-images" class="margin-toggle

      provided by Wobblin' Goblin has cross faction, bots and scaling to allow
      for a good single player or small group experience. Think of our Docker
      image as a repack that is easily updated.</p>

      <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
      <p>You'll need Docker Desktop to get started. <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Download Docker
      Desktop</a> and install it.<label for="sn-windows-wsl"
      class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
      id="sn-windows-wsl" class="margin-toggle"/><span
      class="sidenote">Windows users should also install <a target="_blank"
      href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-subsystem-for-linux/9P9TQF7MRM4R">Windows
      Subsystem for Linux</a> from the Microsoft Store and use it as the Docker
      Desktop backend.</span> Once you have Docker Desktop running installing
      the server is done in three easy steps.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--run-image">Run Image</h3>
          <p>In Docker Desktop go to the search bar (<code>Ctrl+K</code>) and
          search for <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code> under the <em>Images</em>
          tab. Once you've found the image you'll want to select it and then hit
          <em>Run</em>. This will will bring up a prompt. Do not hit
          <em>Run</em> again.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--enter-settings">Enter Settings</h3>
          <p>In the prompt open <em>Optional settings</em> and make sure your
          settings match the below image and then hit <em>Run</em>.</p>

          <img src="/img/optional-settings.png">

          <p>You'll be taken to the server's logs where you'll need to wait for
          the server to initialize before you can login. First-time setup can
          take a few minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--login">Login</h3>
          <p>Leave Docker Desktop and set the realm list of your 3.3.5a client
          to <code>127.0.0.1</code>.  Open your 3.3.5a client and then use the
          username <code>acore</code> and password <code>acore</code> to log
          into the administrator account.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>Once you're logged into the administrator account create a game master
      (GM) character with a name of your choice. This will be the character
      you'll manage the server with.</p>

      <p>It's recommended that you use a separate player account for playing by
      yourself or with others. To create another account enter the following
      command<label for="sn-gm-commands" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-gm-commands"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See AzerothCore's website
      for a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/gm-commands">list of GM
      commands</a>.</span> into chat</p>

      <pre><code>.account create $account $password</code></pre>

      <p>Where you should replace <code>$account</code> with your account name
      and <code>$password</code> with your account's password.</p>

      <p>You can now log into your player account and begin playing!</p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p><em>How do I get help?</em> <a target="_blank"
      href="https://discord.wobgob.org">Join the community</a> to get help with
      Docker Desktop or running your server.</p>

      <p><em>How do I use the bots?</em> Refer to the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots#readme">NPCBots README</a>
      to learn how to use the bots.</p>

      <p><em>How do I play with others?</em> Unless you port forward or use a
      tunneling service you'll only be able to play with others in your local
      area network. You'll also need to update the <code>address</code> field in
      the <code>acore_auth.realmlist</code> database table with your external IP
      address.</p>

      <p><em>How do I change the configuration?</em> You'll need to download the
      code from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/wobgob/azerothcore/"><code>wobgob/azerothcore</code></a>.
      You can then edit the configuration in <code>etc</code>. When running your
      container create another volume and set the host path to the
      <code>etc</code> directory and the container path should be
      <code>/azerothcore/etc</code>.</p>

      <p><em>How do I backup my data?</em> You'll need to use a database tool to
      dump your database's contents. To connect to the database the server host
      should be <code>127.0.0.1</code>, the port is <code>3306</code>, the
      username is <code>acore</code> and the password is <code>acore</code>.</p>

      <p><em>How do I contribute?</em> The best way to contribute is to <a
      target="_blank" href="https://discord.wobgob.org">join the community</a>
      to help others and to share and discuss your creations.</p>
