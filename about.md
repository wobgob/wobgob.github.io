# Welcome to Wobblin' Goblin!
It's nice to meet you.

## Our goals
* Easy to install and up to date images of common [emulators](/about/emulators.html)
* Central authentication that allows a public realm list
* Quality documentation for running, changing, and improving your emulator
* A community to support you in your studies as you gain a useful skill set
* Open source and free forever (as in speech and beer)

## About us
Wobblinâ€™ Goblin is a community where we run, study, change, and improve our emulators together. You'll learn about programming, system administration, and databases amongst other things. While developing your emulator you get to play with others while you learn.

## Our team
* [Jeffi](/about/jeffi.html)
* Underminus
