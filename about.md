# Welcome to Wobblin' Goblin!
*It's nice to meet you.*

## Our goals
* Easy to install and up to date images of [cores](/about/cores.html)
* Central authentication that allows a public realm list
* Quality documentation for maintaining, changing, and improving your server
* Large community to support you as you gain a useful skill set
* Open source and free forever (as in speech and beer)

## About us
Wobblinâ€™ Goblin is a community where we run, study, change, and improve our servers. You'll learn about programming, system administration, and databases amongst other things. While developing your server you get to play with others while learning.
