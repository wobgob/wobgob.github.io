    <section>
      <p><em>AzerothCore for Docker Desktop</em> is a great way to start an <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.azerothcore.org/">AzerothCore</a> server
      for yourself or for your family and friends. The only requirement is
      Docker Desktop<label for="sn-docker-desktop" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-docker-desktop"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Docker is a platform for
      helping people build, share and run applications. Docker Desktop is a
      graphical application for building and sharing applications and services
      on the Docker platform.</span> which we will install as part of the
      tutorial.</p>

      <p>Minimal technical expertise is required for this tutorial outside
      reading some instructions and some copying and pasting. We'll mostly be
      relying on Docker Desktop and in-game commands to run our server so little
      command line knowledge is necessary.</p>

      <p><code>wobgob/azerothcore</code> is a Docker image<label

      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A Docker image is a file
      used to execute code in a Docker container. A Docker container is a
      runnable instance of an image.</span> provided by Wobblin' Goblin with
      opinionated defaults to allow for a good single player or small group
      experience. At a later date instructions will be provided for compiling
      the images from source code to create custom experiences.</p>

      <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>You'll need Docker Desktop to get started. You can find installation
      instructions for <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">Windows</a><label
      for="sn-windows-install" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-windows-install"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">On Windows you'll want to
      use Windows Subsytem for Linux as Docker's backend. You can learn to <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Install
      Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> on Microsoft's website.</span>, <a

      href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/">Mac</a>, and
      <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/">Linux</a> on
      Docker's website. This is the hardest part of the tutorial so read the
      installation instructions carefully and if you run into any problems don't
      be afraid to <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.wobgob.org">ask the
      community for help</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
      <p>Once you have Docker Desktop installing the server is done in three easy steps.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pull or run <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code> from Docker Hub</li>
        <li>Enter the settings required to run <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code></li>
        <li>Wait for the server to initialize before logging in with your 3.3.5a client</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--run-image">Run Image</h3>
          <p>In Docker Desktop go to the search bar (<code>Ctrl+K</code>) and
          search for <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code>. Once you've found the
          image you'll want to start with the <code>latest</code> tag and then
          hit <em>Run</em> which will prompt you for more input.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--enter-settings">Enter Settings</h3>
          <p>Open <em>Optional settings</em> and make sure your settings
          match the below image then hit <em>Run</em>.</p>
          <img src="/img/optional-settings.png" />
          <p>In general,</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The container name can be anything. We've chosen to go with a
            randomly generated name.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Host ports should match container ports.</p>

              <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Exposing port <code>3306</code> can
              be a security vulnerability as anyone with access to that port can
              access your database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The host path can be anything. We've chosen to go with a 
              volume<label for="sn-named-volume" class="margin-toggle
              sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
              id="sn-named-volume" class="margin-toggle"/><span
              class="sidenote">Volumes are the preferred mechanism for
              persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.</span>
              named after the container path.</p>

              <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Do not delete your volume in Docker
              Desktop without backing it up or you'll lose all your data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The container path must be <code>/var/lib/mysql</code></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--login">Login</h3>
          <p>You'll be taken to the server's logs where you'll need to wait for
          the server to initialize before you can login. This can take a few
          minutes.</p>

          <p>Set the realm list of your 3.3.5a client to <code>127.0.0.1</code>
          then use the username <code>acore</code> and password
          <code>acore</code> to log into the console account.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>Once you're logged into the console account create a game master
      character with a name of your choice. This will be the character you
      manage the server with.</p>

      <p>It's recommended you change the password of the console account if
      you're playing with others. To change the password enter the following
      command<label for="sn-gm-commands" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-gm-commands"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See AzerothCore's website
      for a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/gm-commands">list of game master
      commands</a>.</span> into chat</p>

      <pre><code>.account password $old_password $new_password $new_password</code></pre>

      <p>Note the dot (<code>.</code>) before the command.</p>

      <p>It's recommended that you use a separate player account for playing by
      yourself or with others. To create another account enter the following
      command into chat</p>

      <pre><code>.account create $account $password</code></pre>

      <p>You can now log into your player account and begin playing!</p>
