      <p><em>AzerothCore for Docker Desktop</em> is a great way to start an <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.azerothcore.org/">AzerothCore</a> server
      for yourself or for your family and friends. The only requirement is
      Docker Desktop<label for="sn-docker-desktop" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-docker-desktop"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Docker is a platform for
      helping people build, share and run applications. Docker Desktop is a
      graphical application for building and sharing applications and services
      on the Docker platform.</span> which you will need to install to follow
      the tutorial.</p>

      <h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
      <p>We assume that you are familiar with playing on a private server and
      have a 3.3.5a client. We'll be relying on Docker Desktop and in-game
      commands to run our server so minimal technical expertise is required.</p>

      <p>The Docker images<label for="sn-docker-images" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-docker-images"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A Docker image is a file
      used to execute code in a Docker container. A Docker container is a
      runnable instance of an image.</span> provided by Wobblin' Goblin have
      opinionated defaults to allow for a good single player or small group
      experience. Think of our Docker images as a repack that is easily
      updated.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>You'll need Docker Desktop to get started. You can find installation
      instructions for <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">Windows</a><label
      for="sn-windows-install" class="margin-toggle

      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">On Windows you'll want to
      use Windows Subsytem for Linux as Docker's backend. You can learn how to
      <a target="_blank"
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Install
      Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> on Microsoft's website.</span>, <a

      <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/">Linux</a> on
      Docker's website. This is the hardest part of the tutorial so read the
      installation instructions carefully and if you run into any problems don't
      be afraid to <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.wobgob.org">ask the
      community for help</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
      <p>Once you have Docker Desktop installing the server is done in three easy steps.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--run-image">Run Image</h3>
          <p>In Docker Desktop go to the search bar in the top right
          (<code>Ctrl+K</code>) and search for <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code>.
          Once you've found the image you'll want to hit <em>Run</em> which will
          bring up a prompt. Do not hit <em>Run</em> again yet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--enter-settings">Enter Settings</h3>
          <p>In the prompt open <em>Optional settings</em> and make sure your
          settings match the below image then hit <em>Run</em>. Each setting is
          explained below.</p>
          <img src="/img/optional-settings.png">
          <ol>
            <li>The container name can be anything. We've chosen to go with a
            randomly generated name.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Host ports should match container ports</p>

              <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Exposing port <code>3306</code> can
              be a security vulnerability as anyone with access to that port can
              access your database. Leave this blank if you're unsure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The host path can be anything. We've chosen to go with a 
              volume<label for="sn-named-volume" class="margin-toggle
              sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
              id="sn-named-volume" class="margin-toggle"/><span
              class="sidenote">Volumes are the preferred mechanism for
              persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.</span>
              named after the container path.</p>

              <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Do not delete your volume in Docker
              Desktop without backing it up or you'll lose all your data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The container path must be <code>/var/lib/mysql</code></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--login">Login</h3>
          <p>You'll be taken to the server's logs where you'll need to wait for
          the server to initialize before you can login. First-time setup can
          take a few minutes.</p>

          <p>Set the realm list of your 3.3.5a client to <code>127.0.0.1</code>
          then use the username <code>acore</code> and password
          <code>acore</code> to log into the console account.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>Once you're logged into the console account create a game master (GM)
      character with a name of your choice. This will be the character you'll
      manage the server with.</p>

      <p>It's recommended that you use a separate player account for playing by
      yourself or with others. To create another account enter the following
      command<label for="sn-gm-commands" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-gm-commands"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See AzerothCore's website
      for a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/gm-commands">list of GM
      commands</a>.</span> into chat</p>

      <pre><code>.account create $account $password</code></pre>

      <p>Where you should replace <code>$account</code> with your account name
      and <code>$password</code> with your account's password.</p>

      <p>You can now log into your player account and begin playing!</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <p><em>How do I change the default configuration?</em> You'll need to get
      a copy of the source code from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/wobgob/azerothcore/">our GitHub</a> to create a
      new image. You'll want to download the <code>hearthside-stories</code>
      branch where you can find configuration files in <code>etc</code> and you
      can place new modules in <code>modules</code>. Finally run the following
      command from the root of your project</p>

      <pre>
        <code>docker build -t azerothcore .</code>
      </pre>

      <p>To create a new image called <code>azerothcore</code> which you can
      then run.</p>

      <p><em>How do I play with others?</em> Unless you port forward or use a
      tunneling service you'll only be able to play with others in your local
      area network.</p>

      <p><em>How do I backup my data?</em> To backup your data you will need to
      expose port <code>3306</code> and use a database tool to dump its
      contents. To connect to the database the server host should be
      <code>127.0.0.1</code>, the port is <code>3306</code>, the username is
      <code>acore</code> and the password is <code>acore</code>.</p>

      <p><em>How do I contribute?</em> The best way to contribute is to <a
      target="_blank" href="https://discord.wobgob.org">join the community</a>
      to help others and to share and discuss your creations.</p>
