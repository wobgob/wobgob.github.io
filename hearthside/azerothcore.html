      class="sidenote">Docker is a platform for helping people build, share and
      run applications. Docker Desktop is a graphical application for building

      great way to start an <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.azerothcore.org/">AzerothCore</a> server for yourself or
      for your family and friends.</p>

      <p>We assume that you are familiar with playing on a private server and
      have a 3.3.5a client. We'll be relying on Docker Desktop and in-game
      commands to run our server so minimal technical expertise is required.</p>

      <p>The Docker image<label for="sn-docker-images" class="margin-toggle

      bots, scaling and individual progression to allow for a good single player
      or small group experience. Think of our Docker image as a repack that is
      easily updated and that you can compile yourself to create your own
      experience.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
      <p>You'll need Docker Desktop to get started. <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Download Docker
      Desktop</a> and install it. Once you have Docker Desktop installing the
      server is done in three easy steps.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--run-image">Run Image</h3>
          <p>In Docker Desktop go to the search bar in the top right
          (<code>Ctrl+K</code>) and search for <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code>.
          Once you've found the image you'll want to hit <em>Run</em> which will
          bring up a prompt. Do not hit <em>Run</em> again yet.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--enter-settings">Enter Settings</h3>
          <p>In the prompt open <em>Optional settings</em> and make sure your
          settings match the below image then hit <em>Run</em>.</p>

          <img src="/img/optional-settings.png">
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 id="installation--login">Login</h3>
          <p>You'll be taken to the server's logs where you'll need to wait for
          the server to initialize before you can login. First-time setup can
          take a few minutes.</p>

          <p>Set the realm list of your 3.3.5a client to <code>127.0.0.1</code>
          then use the username <code>acore</code> and password
          <code>acore</code> to log into the console account.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>Once you're logged into the console account create a game master (GM)
      character with a name of your choice. This will be the character you'll
      manage the server with.</p>

      <p>It's recommended that you use a separate player account for playing by
      yourself or with others. To create another account enter the following
      command<label for="sn-gm-commands" class="margin-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-gm-commands"
      class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See AzerothCore's website
      for a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/gm-commands">list of GM
      commands</a>.</span> into chat</p>

      <pre><code>.account create $account $password</code></pre>

      <p>Where you should replace <code>$account</code> with your account name
      and <code>$password</code> with your account's password.</p>

      <p>You can now log into your player account and begin playing!</p>

      <p><em>How do I use the bots?</em> Refer to the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots#readme">NPCBots README</a>
      to learn how to use the bots.</p>

      <p><em>How do I play with others?</em> Unless you port forward or use a
      tunneling service you'll only be able to play with others in your local
      area network.</p>

      <p><em>How do I backup my data?</em> To backup your data you will need to
      expose port <code>3306</code> and use a database tool to dump its
      contents. To connect to the database the server host should be
      <code>127.0.0.1</code>, the port is <code>3306</code>, the username is
      <code>acore</code> and the password is <code>acore</code>.</p>

      <p><em>How do I contribute?</em> The best way to contribute is to <a

      to help others and to share and discuss your creations.</p>

      <h2 id="appendix-compiling">Appendix: Compiling</h2>
      <p>Compiling yourself is a great way to create your own custom AzerothCore
      experience. To start compiling you'll need to complete the following
      steps.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/join">Join Github</a></li>

        <li>Download and install <a target="_blank"
        href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a><label
        for="sn-github-desktop" class="margin-toggle
        sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-github-desktop"
        class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Linux users can find
        releases at <a target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases">shiftkey/desktop</a></span>
        and <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual
        Studio Code</a></li>

        <li>Open GitHub Desktop and in the <strong>File </strong> menu click
        <strong>Clone Repository...</strong></li>
        <img src="/img/clone-file-menu.png">

        <li>Click <strong>URL</strong> and enter
        <code>wobgob/azerothcore</code>. Click <strong>Choose...</strong> and
        navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository then
        click <strong>Clone</strong>.</li>
        <img src="/img/clone-repository.png">

        <li>Click <strong>For my own purposes</strong> then click
        <strong>Continue</strong></li>
        <img src="/img/windows-fork-own-purposes.png">

        <li>After cloning, in the <strong>Repository</strong> menu click
        <strong>Open in Visual Studio Code</strong></li>

        <li>In Visual Studio Code you can edit the configuration files in the
        <code>etc</code> folder</li>
        <img src="/img/visual-studio-code.png">

        <li>After you have saved your edits, in the <strong>Terminal</strong>
        menu click <strong>New Terminal</strong></li>

        <li>In the Terminal enter <code>docker build -t azerothcore .</code> to
        compile your image</li>

        <li>Compilation can take a while but once it's finished you can find
        your new image called <code>azerothcore</code> in Docker Desktop to
        run</li>
        <img src="/img/docker-desktop-images.png">
      </ol>

      <p>This is just a bare minimum example of changing configuration files.
      You can also add modules from the <a target="_blank"
